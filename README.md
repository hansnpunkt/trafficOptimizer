# trafficOptimizer
Used SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to run a traffic simulation and optimized the traffic light phase durations for better network throughput. 

First step is to create a network that you will be using for the simulation and optimization. SUMO comes with a helper (https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tutorials/OSMWebWizard.html) where you can select a bounding box of open streetmap and then create the traffic network.
